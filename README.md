## 😄 Hello there!

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ⚔️ The challenge

The ideia of the challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

After finishing, I went to search of other professionals who already solved the challenge to se how I could improve. Satisfied with the result and movind on to the next one!

This project is a collaboration between FrontEndMentor, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell. Actually you can see how Kevin would tackle the project: [follow along on Scrimba's free course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel). 

**I done all by myself and after that I`ll see how Kevin Powell made it.**

On this project you can see:
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
